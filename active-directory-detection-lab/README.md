# üèóÔ∏è Active Directory Lab

**Analyst:** Peter Van Rossum  
**Date Range Built:** September 2025  
**Environment:** Home Lab (Virtualized)  
**Core Components:** Windows Server (Domain Controller), Windows 10 Client, Ubuntu Server (Splunk SIEM), Kali Linux Attack Machine 

‚ö°This Active Directory Lab walkthrough is based on the excellent [MyDFIR "Active Directory Project (Home Lab)" YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/@MyDFIR), with additional notes, detections, and explanations written from my own build process.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Considerations

This lab is a **controlled, isolated environment** I built for training. While the setup mirrors many real-world enterprise components, there are important considerations:

- Configurations are sometimes intentionally insecure (e.g., weak passwords, open RDP) to simulate adversary actions.  
- All attacks are conducted against my own lab systems using a NAT/Host-Only virtual network.  
- Telemetry will not perfectly match enterprise-scale environments but is close enough for learning SOC workflows.  

The purpose is not production hardening, but **hands-on experience with detection engineering**.

---

## üéØ Objective

My goal was to create a **mini-enterprise Active Directory environment** where I could:

- Stand up a Windows domain (users, policies, DNS).  
- Deploy Sysmon and Splunk Universal Forwarder to capture endpoint telemetry.  
- Send that telemetry into Splunk for searching, dashboards, and alerts.  
- Run controlled attacks from Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team.  
- Detect those attacks using SPL queries and Event IDs.  

This project mirrors what a SOC analyst or detection engineer would do in the field.

# üß≠ Lab Build Timeline and Findings

## ‚úÖ Part 1 ‚Äì Planning

I began by defining the environment and requirements:

- **Virtual Machines:**  
  - `DC01`: Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller)  
  - `WIN10-CLIENT`: Windows 10, joined to the domain  
  - `SPLUNK`: Splunk Enterprise server  
  - `KALI`: Kali Linux attacker box  

- **Networking:** NAT/Host-Only for safety.  
- **Static IPs:**  
  - DC01 ‚Üí 192.168.10.5  
  - WIN10-CLIENT ‚Üí 192.168.10.10  
  - SPLUNK ‚Üí 192.168.10.20  
  - KALI ‚Üí 192.168.10.30  

**Why this matters:**  
Upfront planning avoids confusion later. With static IPs and a clear design, Splunk correlation becomes easier and my detections remain consistent.

---

## ‚úÖ Part 2 ‚Äì Building the Environment

### Windows Server (DC01)
- Installed Windows Server.  
- Renamed host to `DC01`.  
- Promoted it to a Domain Controller with forest `lab.local`.  
- DNS installed automatically with AD DS role.  

### Windows 10 Client
- Installed Windows 10.  
- Joined `lab.local` domain.  
- Verified login with domain credentials.  

### Splunk Enterprise
- Installed Splunk Enterprise (free 500MB/day license).  
- Verified access to Splunk Web UI.  

### Kali Linux
- Updated repositories.  
- Installed Hydra, Crowbar, and CrackMapExec.  
- Prepared wordlists for brute force testing.  

**Why this matters:**  
At this stage, I had a functioning enterprise-like network: a domain, a workstation, a SIEM, and an attacker. This forms the foundation for detection engineering.

---

## ‚úÖ Part 3 ‚Äì Active Directory & Telemetry

### AD Configuration
- Created user accounts, including a weak ‚Äútestuser‚Äù account.  
- Applied GPOs:  
  - Password complexity.  
  - Audit policy for logon and process creation.  
  - Enabled Remote Desktop for RDP attack simulations.  

### Sysmon Deployment
- Installed Sysmon on DC01 and WIN10-CLIENT.  
- Used SwiftOnSecurity‚Äôs Sysmon configuration for comprehensive telemetry.  

### Splunk Universal Forwarder
- Installed Splunk UF on both Windows hosts.  
- Configured `inputs.conf` to forward critical logs:

    [WinEventLog://Application]  
    index = endpoint  
    disabled = false  

    [WinEventLog://Security]  
    index = endpoint  
    disabled = false  

    [WinEventLog://System]  
    index = endpoint  
    disabled = false  

    [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational]  
    index = endpoint  
    disabled = false  
    renderXml = true  

Restarted the SplunkForwarder service to apply changes.

**Why this matters:**  
Telemetry is everything. Without Sysmon + Security logs flowing into Splunk, there‚Äôs nothing to analyze or detect. This step was about wiring my environment so Splunk could ‚Äúsee.‚Äù

---

## ‚úÖ Part 4 ‚Äì Splunk Setup & Detection Engineering

### AD User Accounts & Permissions
Before wiring logs into Splunk, I needed realistic users and groups in AD so my detections had meaningful context.

- **Users:**  
  - `testuser` ‚Äî weak password, used only for brute-force tests.  
  - `analyst.peter` ‚Äî everyday non-admin account.  

- **Groups:**  
  - `SecOps-Lab-Users` ‚Äî standard users.  
  - `SecOps-Remote-Desktop` ‚Äî added to the client‚Äôs **Remote Desktop Users** local group so I could RDP without full admin rights.  

**Why this matters:**  
Creating distinct accounts and assigning RDP rights by group ensures Splunk logs show the *who* and *how* behind logon events. It also mirrors real enterprises where access is role-based, not just handed out via local admin.

---

### Splunk Index & Ingestion
On the Splunk server, I created a dedicated index:

- **Index Name:** `endpoint`  
- **Data Type:** Events  

I verified events were flowing with:

    index=endpoint | stats count by host, source

Expected sources included:  
- `WinEventLog:Security`  
- `WinEventLog:System`  
- `WinEventLog:Application`  
- `WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`  

---

### Key Event IDs
**Windows Security Logs:** 4625 (failed logon), 4624 (successful logon), 4672 (privileged logon), 4688 (process creation).  
**Sysmon Logs:** 1 (process create), 3 (network connection), 7 (image loaded), 11 (file created), 13 (registry modification), 22 (DNS query).  

---

### Core SPL Queries
*(These come from common SOC playbooks, not directly from MyDFIR ‚Äî they extend the lab into detection engineering.)*

**Failed logons by user/IP:**

    index=endpoint source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625
    | stats count BY TargetUserName, IpAddress
    | sort - count

**Brute-force success correlation:**

    index=endpoint source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode IN (4625,4624)
    | eval outcome=if(EventCode=4625,"fail","success")
    | stats count AS attempts, values(outcome) AS outcomes by TargetUserName, IpAddress
    | where attempts>=10 AND mvfind(outcomes,"success")>=0

**Suspicious PowerShell activity:**

    index=endpoint source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=1 Image="*\\powershell.exe"
    | eval encoded=if(match(CommandLine,"(?i)-enc"),"Base64_Encoded","Plain")
    | table _time, host, User, CommandLine, encoded

---

### Dashboards & Alerts
I built a dashboard with panels for failed logons, suspicious PowerShell, and file drops in Temp/AppData.  
I also set an alert: **‚ÄúBrute Force Succeeded‚Äù** ‚Äî triggered when failures are followed by a success within 15 minutes.  

**Why this matters:**  
By the end of Part 4, Splunk wasn‚Äôt just collecting logs ‚Äî it was surfacing meaningful detections tied back to specific users and accounts I had configured in AD.


---

## ‚úÖ Part 5 ‚Äì Attack & Detect

### Brute Force with Kali

**RDP attack with crowbar:**

    sudo crowbar -b rdp -s 192.168.10.10/32 -u testuser -C passwords.txt

**SMB attack with hydra:**

    hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt smb://192.168.10.10 -V -f

**Splunk Detection:**  
- Burst of 4625 events (failures).  
- A single 4624 (success).  
- 4672 if admin privileges assigned.  

---

### Atomic Red Team (ART)

**Install ART:**

    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
    iwr https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/get-atomics.ps1 -UseBasicParsing -OutFile get-atomics.ps1
    .\get-atomics.ps1

**Run tests:**

**T1059.001 ‚Äì PowerShell Encoded Command**

    Invoke-AtomicTest T1059.001 -TestNumbers 1 -Path "C:\AtomicRedTeam"

- Expect: Sysmon EID 1 with `-enc` in command line.

**T1547.001 ‚Äì Registry Run Key Persistence**

    Invoke-AtomicTest T1547.001 -TestNumbers 1 -Path "C:\AtomicRedTeam"

- Expect: Sysmon EID 13 (registry modification).

**T1105 ‚Äì Ingress Tool Transfer**

    Invoke-AtomicTest T1105 -TestNumbers 1 -Path "C:\AtomicRedTeam"

- Expect: Sysmon EID 11 (file create) + EID 3 (network connection).

**Cleanup:**

    Invoke-AtomicTest T1547.001 -TestNumbers 1 -Path "C:\AtomicRedTeam" -Cleanup

### Splunk Detections

**Encoded PowerShell:**

    index=endpoint EventCode=1 Image="*\\powershell.exe" CommandLine="*-enc*"
    | table _time, host, User, CommandLine

**Registry persistence:**

    index=endpoint EventCode=13
    | regex TargetObject="(?i)\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run"
    | table _time, host, TargetObject, Details

**File drop + network connection:**

    index=endpoint (EventCode=11 OR EventCode=3)
    | table _time, host, EventCode, Image, CommandLine, TargetFilename, DestinationIp, DestinationPort

**Why this matters:**  
Now I wasn‚Äôt just building infrastructure ‚Äî I was simulating adversaries and catching them in Splunk. This completed the defender feedback loop.
